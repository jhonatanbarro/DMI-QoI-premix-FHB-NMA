This website provides easy access to commented R scripts that allows reproducing the analysis of the data from our publication.

In this study, we used a network meta-analytic approach to compare the performance of six fungicides, including strobilurin-triazole premixes and a single triazole, evaluated during 15 years (2000 to 2018) of experimentation across a range of environments in three Brazilian states (PR, RS and SC) for controling Fusarium Head Blight (caused by *Fusarium graminearum* species complex). We checked whether at least portion of the heterogeneity in treatment effects could be explained by baseline levels of disease or yield.  Additionally, we further used the mean and uncertainty of the meta-analytic estimates in risk analysis for aiding decision making with regards the profitability of representative registered fungicides under a range of scenarios.
